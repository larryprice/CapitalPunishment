OVERVIEW
Capital Punishment is a web application to test the user's knowledge of geography. The application quizzes the user by presenting a question and five possible answers. The question is of the form 'What is the capital of X?' or 'Whose capital is Y?' The type of question can be changed by clicking on the icon in the center of the page. Other game modes are available by clicking the region icons on the left side of the page.

TECHNOLOGY
This app is written using Ruby 1.9.3. Gems include Sinatra for web development and Nokogiri for data scraping. The Twitter Bootstrap is used to make everything a little bit prettier.
