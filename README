OVERVIEW
Capital Punishment is a pain-free way to memorize states and capitals. Pick your poison from the side bar, and then match the given state to its capital and answer the next question. If you can't get the hang of a question, just move on and try again later. You'll be shocked at how well you know your states and capitals when you're done playing. Click the center button to inject a twist into your game by getting a capital and then answering with the state!
