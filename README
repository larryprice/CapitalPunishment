OVERVIEW
CapitalPunishment is a web application to test the user's knowledge of
geography. Initially, CapitalPunishment asks the user a simple
question: What is the capital of 'X,' where 'X' is a country. The user
then clicks 1 of 5 radio buttons to select the appropriate country,
and cliks 'Submit' when ready. The application then tells the user
whether or not they are correct. This continues ad infinitum. If the
user clicks the icon in the upper part of the page, the game will
reverse and the user will be given a capital and have to choose which
country the capital belongs to. A button in the bottom left also
allows the user to switch from World Mode to US Mode. In US Mode, the
choices are US states and capitals, otherwise the game is played the
same.

TECHNOLOGY
